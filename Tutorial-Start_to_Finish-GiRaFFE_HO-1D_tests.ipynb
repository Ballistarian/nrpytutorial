    "Here we use NRPy+ to generate the C source code necessary to set up initial data for a model neutron star (see [the original GiRaFFE paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00599.pdf)). Then we use it to generate the RHS expressions for [Method of Lines](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NDSolveMethodOfLines.html) time integration based on the [explicit Runge-Kutta fourth-order scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) (RK4).\n",

    "    1. (**Step 4** below) Apply singular, curvilinear coordinate boundary conditions [*a la* the SENR/NRPy+ paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07658)\n",
    "1. (**Step 3B** below) At the end of each iteration in time, output the <font color='green'>FFE variables</font>. (This is in Step 3B, because Step 4 requires that *all* gridfunctions be defined.)\n",
    "1. Repeat above steps at two numerical resolutions to confirm convergence to the expected value."
