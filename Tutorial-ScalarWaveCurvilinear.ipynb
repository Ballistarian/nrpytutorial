    "As we learned in the [NRPy+ tutorial module on reference metrics](Tutorial-Reference_Metric.ipynb), reference metrics are a means to pick the best coordinate system for the PDE we wish to solve. However, to take advantage of reference metrics requires first that we generalize the PDE. In the case of the scalar wave equation, this involves first rewriting in [Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) via\n",

    "For example, suppose we wish to model a short-wavelength wave that is nearly spherical. In this case, if we were to solve the wave equation PDE in Cartesian coordinates, we would in principle need high resolution in all three cardinal directions. If instead we chose spherical coordinates centered at the center of the wave, we might need high resolution only in the radial direction, with only a few points required in the angular directions. Thus choosing spherical coordinates would be far more computationally efficient than modeling the wave in Cartesian coordinates.\n",
