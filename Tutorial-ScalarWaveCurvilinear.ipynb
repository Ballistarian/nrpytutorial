In this case, if we were to solve the wave equation PDE in Cartesian coordinates, we would in principle need high resolution in all three cardinal directions. If instead we chose spherical coordinates centered at the center of the wave, we might need high resolution only in the radial direction, with only a few points required in the angular directions. Thus choosing spherical coordinates would be far more computationally efficient than modeling the wave in Cartesian coordinates.\n",
