    "NRPy+ (\"Python-based code generation for numerical relativity... and beyond!\") is a Python-based code, in which user-specified expressions in indexed notation are output as highly optimized C code. It makes extensive use of [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org) for algebraic manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As NRPy+ was originally designed for generating C code at the heart of finite-difference-based numerical relativity codes, it contains a number of modules for solving PDEs that are useful for a large class of [hyperbolic systems of PDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_partial_differential_equation), like the [scalar wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation).\n",
