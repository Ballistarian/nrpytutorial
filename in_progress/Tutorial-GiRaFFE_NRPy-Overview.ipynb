    "# `GiRaFFE_NRPy`: Basic equations and modules\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authors: Patrick Nelson &\n",
    "\n",
    "`GiRaFFE_NRPy` rewrites the original `GiRaFFE` in a manner made to be more compatible with NRPy+, allowing us to generate large, complicated portions of the code quickly and easily. It solves the equations of General-Relativistic, Force-Free Electrodynamics (GRFFE), an special case of General-Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in which pressures and densities are zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, initial data must first be generated. Conventionally, this is given in the forms of equations describing the vector potential $A_i$ and electric field $E^i$. From these expressions, $A_i$ is set directly; the magnetic field $B^i$ is computed from $A_i$ analytically and, with $E^i$, used to calculate the initial Valencia 3-velocity $\\bar{v}^i$. Then, the densitized Poynting flux $\\tilde{S}_i$ is calculated from $\\bar{v}^i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each timestep, the $A_i$ and $\\tilde{S}_i$ are advanced through time by using reconstruction methods and solving the Riemann problem, as well as an RK solver. Then, $B^i$ is numerically calculated from $A_i$ and fixes are applied to $\\tilde{S}_i$ before calculating $\\bar{v}^i$ at the new timestep. Another algorithm is applied to $\\bar{v}^i$ to preserve current sheets in the $x$-$y$ plane, and $\\tilde{S}_i$ is updated to be consistent with these changes. \n",
