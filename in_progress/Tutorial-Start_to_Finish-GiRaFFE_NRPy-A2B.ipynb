    "# Unit Testing `GiRaFFE_NRPy`: $A_k$ to $B^i$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Author: Patrick Nelson\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook validates our A-to-B solver for use in `GiRaFFE_NRPy`. Because the original `GiRaFFE` used staggered grids and we do not, we can not trivially do a direct comparison to the old code. Instead, we will compare the numerical results with the expected analytic results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Module Status:** <font color=red><b> In-Progress </b></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Notes:** This module will validate the routines in [Tutorial-GiRaFFE_HO_C_code_library-A2B](../Tutorial-GiRaFFE_HO_C_code_library-A2B.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is, in general, good coding practice to unit test functions individually to verify that they produce the expected and intended output. Here, we expect our functions to produce the correct cross product in an arbitrary spacetime. To that end, we will choose functions that are easy to differentiate, but lack the symmetries that would trivialize the finite-difference algorithm. Higher-order polynomials are one such type of function. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the simplest case - testing the second-order solver. In second-order finite-differencing, we use a three-point stencil that can exactly differentiate polynomials up to quadratic. So, we will use cubic functions three variables. For instance,\n",

    "It will be much simpler to let NRPy+ handle most of this work. So, we will import the core functionality of NRPy+, build the expressions, and then output them using `outputC()`."
