    "FD techniques are usually equivalent to first finding the unique $N$th degree polynomial that passes through $N+1$ sampled points of our function ($u$) in the neighborhood of where we wish to find the derivative. Then, provided $u$ is smooth and properly-sampled, the $M$th derivative of the polynomial (where $M\\le N-1$; *Exercise: Justify this inequality*) is an approximate $M$th derivative of $u$ called the *$M$th-order finite difference derivative*. The approximation error generally decreases as the polynomial degree or sampling density increases.\n",
