    "\n",
    "FD techniques are usually equivalent to first finding the unique $N$th degree polynomial that passes through $N+1$ sampled points of our function ($u$) in the neighborhood of where we wish to find the derivative. Then, provided $u$ is smooth and properly-sampled, the $M$th derivative of the polynomial (where $M\\le N-1$; *Exercise: Justify this inequality*) is an approximate $M$th derivative of $u$ called the *$M$th-order finite difference derivative*. The approximation error generally decreases as the polynomial degree or sampling density increases.\n",

    "Finite difference derivatives are written in the form\n",
    "$$u^{(n)}(x_i)_{\\text{FD}} = \\sum_{j} u_j a_j,$$\n",
