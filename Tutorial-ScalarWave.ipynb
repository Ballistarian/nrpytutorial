    "## Generating C code for the right-hand-side of the scalar wave equation, in Cartesian coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to numerically solve the scalar wave equation in Cartesian coordinates:\n",
    "$$\\partial_t^2 u = c^2 \\nabla^2 u \\text{,}$$\n",
    "where $u$ is a function of time and space: $u = u(t,x,y,...)$ (spatial dimension as-yet unspecified) and $c$ is the wave speed,\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to some initial condition\n",
    "$$u(0,x,y,...) = f(x,y,...)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and suitable, approximate spatial boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define \n",
    "$$v(t,x,y,...) = \\partial_t u(t,x,y,...)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the second-order PDE is reduced to a set of two coupled first-order PDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\partial_t u &= v \\\\\n",
    "\\partial_t v &= c^2 \\nabla^2 u.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our goal will be to generate C code capable of computing the right-hand sides of the above equation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Solution to the Wave Equation \n",
    "\n",
    "We will find that breaking the second-order time derivative into two first-order, coupled equations in this way is quite convenient numerically, as it enables us to step forward in time using the Method of Lines. This method enables us to handle timestepping the same way we would handle an ODE integration, allowing us to use [Runge-Kutta methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) for timestepping. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the $\\nabla^2 u$ term, spatial derivatives are handled in NRPy+ via [finite differencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will sample the solution $\\{u,v\\}$ at discrete, uniformly-sampled points in space and time For simplicity, let's assume that we consider the wave equation in one spatial dimension. Then the solution at any sampled point in space and time is given by\n",
    "$$u^n_i = u(t_n,x_i) = u(t_0 + n \\Delta t, x_0 + i \\Delta x),$$\n",
    "where $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x$ represent the temporal and spatial resolution, respectively. $v^n_i$ is sampled at the same points in space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Derivatives: the $\\nabla^2$ Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize complication, we will restrict ourselves to solving the wave equation in one spatial dimension, so\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 u = \\partial_x^2 u.$$\n",
    "Extension of this operator to higher spatial dimensions is straightforward, particularly when using NRPy+.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was discussed in [the finite difference section of the tutorial](Tutorial-Finite_Difference_Derivatives.ipynb), NRPy+ approximates derivatives using [finite difference methods](),  the second-order derivative $\\partial_x^2$ accurate to fourth-order in uniform grid spacing $\\Delta x$ (from fitting the unique 4th-degree polynomial to 5 sample points of $u$) is given by\n",
