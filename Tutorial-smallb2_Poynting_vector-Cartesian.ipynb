    "\n",
    "First some definitions. The spatial components of $b^{\\mu}$ are simply the magnetic field as measured by an observer comoving with the plasma $B^{\\mu}_{\\rm (u)}$, divided by $\\sqrt{4\\pi}$. In addition, in the ideal MHD limit, $B^{\\mu}_{\\rm (u)}$ is orthogonal to the plasma 4-velocity $u^\\mu$, which sets the $\\mu=0$ component. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that $B^{\\mu}_{\\rm (u)}$ is related to the magnetic field as measured by a *normal* observer $B^i$ via a simple projection (Eq 21 in Duez et al), which results in the expressions (Eqs 23 and 24 in Duez et al):\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sqrt{4\\pi} b^0 = B^0_{\\rm (u)} &= \\frac{u_j B^j}{\\alpha} \\\\\n",
    "\\sqrt{4\\pi} b^i = B^i_{\\rm (u)} &= \\frac{B^i + (u_j B^j) u^i}{\\alpha u^0}\\\\\n",
