    "### The Physical System of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two compact objects (e.g. black holes or neutron stars) with masses $m_{1}$, $m_{2}$ (in solar masses) and spin angular momenta ${\\bf S}_{1}$, ${\\bf S}_{2}$ in a binary system.  The spinning effective one-body (\"SEOB\") Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm real}$ (see [BB2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3517) Equation (5.69)) describes the dynamics of this system.  We seek initial conditions for nonadiabatic evolutions of such a system, and follow [BCD2006](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0508067) Section IV A.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the initial conditions, we begin with the following system parameters:\n",
    "1. the mass of each compact object, denoted $m_{1}$, $m_{2}$,\n",
    "1. the spin vector of each compact object, denoted ${\\bf S}_{1}$, ${\\bf S}_{2}$, and\n",
    "1. initial orbital frequency $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose a right-handed spatial coordinate basis $\\left\\{ {\\bf e}_{0}, {\\bf e}_{1}, {\\bf e}_{2} \\right\\}$ so that the initial separation vector ${\\bf r}$ between the compact objects lies along the ${\\bf e}_{0}$-axis and the orbital plane coincides with the ${\\bf e}_{0}$, ${\\bf e}_{1}$-plane.  Assume that ${\\bf S}_{1}$, ${\\bf S}_{2}$ are written in this basis.  Our goal is to produce initial dynamical variables\n",
    "1. ${\\bf x} = \\left( x, y, z \\right)$, and\n",
    "1. ${\\bf p} = \\left( p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z} \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We include below the physical parameters necessary to compute the initial conditions.  Besides the physical parameters, we also need the [Euler–Mascheroni constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant) $\\gamma$ and the [geomtrized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrized_unit_system) solar mass $\\mathcal{M}_{\\odot}$, both hard-coded in LALSuite with the significant digits shown below.  (The following link directly to the appropriate LALSuite documentation: [$\\gamma$](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/lalsuite/lal/group___l_a_l_constants__h.html#gac6af32574ff8acaeeafe8bf422281e98) and [$\\mathcal{M}_{\\odot}$](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/lalsuite/lal/group___l_a_l_constants__h.html#gab83f8c705dda3fd0bb2d5f2470bb9cdd).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that throughout this notebook we adpot the following conventions:\n",
    "1. $c = G = 1$ where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum and $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant,\n",
    "1. $m_{1} \\ge m_{2}$,\n",
    "1. hatted vectors (e.g. $\\hat{\\bf L}_{N}$) usually denote scaled or unit vectors, and\n",
    "1. the initial inclination angle $\\iota$ of the system relative to some observer is chosen to be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>Please note that in [BCD2006](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0508067) the initial conditions are solved for given an initial separation; here we use a given initial frequency instead.  The difference is in our approach to solving Equation (4.8).  Our approach also differs from that found in LALSuite's SEOBNRv3 code XLALSimIMRSpinEOBInitialConditionsPrec() function (file: LALSimIMRSpinEOBInitialConditionsPrec.c) because we choose our intial coordinate system so that the inclination angle $\\iota$ is zero and $m_{1} \\ge m_{2}$..</font>\n",
